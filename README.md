# My_Game_Of_Life
"Game of Life" is a captivating turn-based simulation devised by mathematician John Conway in the 1970s. It is not a conventional game but an array-based representation of living and empty cells. The game evolves based on two simple rules: survival (a cell survives with 2 or 3 neighbors) and birth (an empty cell becomes alive with 3 neighbors).
